Please request access via (917) 727-2507 for no access to politically sensitive data and compliance.
The government is bound to transparency, constituents and employees are not classified as a government entity.
I will consider granting beneficial information personally created if anyone can find a phone with the following dimensions:

Registered under SKT (South Korea Telecom), no data plan, incompatible with US Sim Cards
Version: iPhoneX iOS 14.5.1
Appearance:  Light teal Otterbox case
Number: +82 10 5121 8838
Serial Number: DNPX50D9JCL9
IMEI: 35 486209 329454 9
Contents: Front line images of activist events, successful revolutions overseas, large scale nationally recognized projects, North Korean peace projects, some roads of all the activist events in NYC/NYS, data, work, registrations to political group chats in different regions where we pulled wins in the opposition home turf irreproducible due to the mechanics of the chats, artwork, performances, speeches, festivals organized, etc.  My mother gifted me the phone before I last saw her in person almost two years ago because I had suffered greatly from a very cheap phone that held a charge for 20 minutes which precluded my options to document events.
If the phone is found, please contact and I will recompense you the full current price of the phone. 

Happy Holidays, the day after the Winter Solstice, and warmest regards!

I don't expect to find it no worries I guess
